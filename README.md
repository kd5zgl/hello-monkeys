My first git repo, yay!

This is my first git repo, committed years ago. Hanging on to this one. (Still) Hope to work with many other happy monkeys and have loads of fun. Cheers and 73, KD5ZGL. (It was hilarious one night on chat with some devs at Microsoft who didn't know me (yet) and I was signed in under my callsign and they were trying to pronounce 'Kd5zgl' Good times :)

## OK, so I took a break :P ##
back to work!
### OK so I took another break! Home again, Thanks Be to God!
And now I have a new amateur radio callsign AG5IS got my Extra Class. Maybe that one will be easier to pronounce on Channel 9.
